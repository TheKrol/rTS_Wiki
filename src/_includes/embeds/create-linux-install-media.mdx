### Windows

import Rufus from './rufus.md';

<Rufus />

### macOS

1. Open the Terminal.
2. First, without the flash drive inserted, run `diskutil list` in the Terminal.
3. Plug in the flash drive and run `diskutil list` again. You can do this to identify the drive device path. The device path is in the form of `/dev/diskN`, where N is a number (example: `/dev/disk1`).
4. Unmount the flash drive you have identified. `diskutil unmountdisk /dev/diskN`.
5. Convert the ISO image. `hdiutil convert /path/to/image.iso -format UDRW -o /path/to/ubuntu.img`
6. Run `sudo dd if=/path/to/image.img of=/dev/rdiskN status=progress` to create a bootable drive from the image. Using `/dev/rdiskN` instead of `/dev/diskN` usually results in faster media creation.
7. Wait until dd finishes. The terminal will display the next prompt when it's done.
8. Eject the USB flash drive: `diskutil eject /dev/diskN`.

### Linux

1. First, without the flash drive inserted, run `lsblk` in the Terminal.
2. Plug in the flash drive and run `lsblk` again. You can do this to identify the drive device path. The device path is usually in the form of `/dev/sdX`, where X is a letter (example: `/dev/sdb`).
4. Run `dd if=/path/to/image.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress` to create a bootable drive from the ISO.
5. Wait until dd finishes. The terminal will display the next prompt when it's done.

### Ventoy (Windows and Linux)

Follow our [Ventoy guide](/docs/guides/ventoy) to make one flash drive that can boot multiple ISO files, this is a more advanced method but suitable for power users who may not have heard about it before.
