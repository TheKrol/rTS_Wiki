## Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs)

Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) are a type of hard disk drive (HDD) or solid state drive (SSD) that encrypt all data on the disk automatically without the need for any additional software or hardware.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- Easy to use: SEDs are simple to use, as encryption is performed automatically in the background. No additional software or hardware is required.
- Improved performance: SEDs are designed to encrypt data at the disk controller level, which minimizes the impact on system performance.
- Increased security: SEDs encrypt all data on the disk, including data in use, which provides a higher level of security than traditional software-based encryption methods.
- More affordable: SEDs are becoming more affordable, making them an attractive option for organizations that need to secure data on a budget.

#### Disadvantages

- Limited compatibility: SEDs are not compatible with all operating systems, and some systems may require additional software to use them.
- Potential reduced performance: In some cases, the encryption process performed by SEDs can reduce system performance.
- Insecure Encryption methods: Not every drive has equal security as it depends on the method used. If the method has flaws or is vulnerable it can't be changed in most cases.

### Risks

- Data loss: If the encryption key is lost or forgotten, the data on the SED will be inaccessible.
- Physical damage: In the event of physical damage to the SED, the encrypted data may become inaccessible.
