> If you are seeing "cyclic redundancy check" anywhere, you will not be able to attempt recovery at home and should seek professional data recovery services.

## Scenarios
### A readable disk
A small obstacle preventing you from using your computer like normal such as:
- My computer won't turn on for some reason
- My computer is BSODing when I turn it on so I cannot get to Windows like normal.
- My laptop screen broke so I can't see anything
- I cannot log into Windows for some reason

For these issues, you can [recover files by attaching your disk to another computer](/disks/data-recovery/drive-dock) or [recover files with a Live Linux Session](/disks/data-recovery/reading-linux).

### My disk is visible but inaccessible
You have a drive that is visible in Windows but it has no data on it. This may be because:
- I deleted partitions on the wrong disk (But did not make new ones)
- I turned my computer on and it says my disk needs to be "initialized"
- My disk is "RAW" in disk management
- My disk is "unknown" in disk management
- My disk is "unallocated" in disk management

For these issues, use [Testdisk](/disks/data-recovery/testdisk) to recover your partition table.

### I accidentally changed data on my disk
You had data on your disk, and it had new data written to it, replacing the old data.
- You formatted the wrong disk
- You installed Windows on the wrong disk
- You installed Linux on the wrong disk
- You formatted and then put data onto the wrong disk

For these issues, use [Photorec](/disks/data-recovery/photorec) to recover individual files.
