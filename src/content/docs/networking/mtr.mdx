The mtr tool combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs in a single network diagnostic tool, it is [Pingplotter](/networking/pingplotter) for Linux.

## Using MTR to troubleshoot
1. Open "terminal emulator" from the application menu
2. Run `mtr <ip or hostname>` where \<ip or hostname\> is a site or game server you are having issues with.
    - To do a basic test you can use "google.com": `mtr google.com`
3. Let mtr run for about 2 minutes then take a screenshot and share it with the channel.
    - To take a screenshot in our live session type "screenshot" in the application menu to open the screenshot utility.
    - After taking your screenshot use the "Host on imgur" option to upload the screenshot and get a URL that you will provide to the chat.
