Trusted have been identified as being of sound mind and at least mildly competent. With this comes advanced permissions and the ability to moderate users. 

1. If you have questions about the need for any moderation action, just ask. It is a "feel" you will develop over time. A tempered action is always better than a rash one.
2. Never change a users name for fun. This permission is only to correct non-English chars or offensive names. If you have questions about the offensiveness of a name, please ask a Moderator.
3. Any action taken is audit-able. Where possible always include a reason. Bans that do not have reasons are instantly appealed, we cannot tell a user "no" if we don't know why they were banned in the first place.
4. If you believe a user, Helper, other Trusted or Moderator is acting rashly, please bring it up with another Moderator. PMs are acceptable for issues such as these.
