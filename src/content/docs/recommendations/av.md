## Windows Defender

The built in solution for AV in Windows is more than adequate for consumers. This is much better than running a free AV suite that is of lesser quality or plans to sell your personal habits for profit (McAfee, Avast, AVG, etc)

## Free Alternatives

All free alternatives are considered PUPs. They will sell you as their product and provide more a more troublesome experience. We do not recommend Avast, AVG, Kaspersky, McAfee or any other alternative AV.

## Paid AV Suites

We do not recommend any paid AV suite for consumers, they do not provide significant advantages over Windows Defender and only increase overhead.

If you have a paid AV installed but wish to remove it please refer to our [list of AV removers](/factoids/av-remover).
