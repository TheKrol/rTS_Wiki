description: How to retrieve an application window that is stuck on a non-existent monitor

When using multiple monitors Windows can "leave" application windows on a monitor that is no longer connected. If this occurs you will notice an application icon on your taskbar that can be minimized and opened but will not be visible on any active monitor.

1. Click the application in your taskbar to open it, this will also "focus" the window.
2. Hold the Windows key then press your left or right arrow key multiple times. This will cause the window to "snap" onto the sides of your monitors and move between them. 
    - If you press left or right enough times the window should re-appear on an active monitor.
