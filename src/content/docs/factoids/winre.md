2. On the first sign that Windows is booting (IE: manufacturer logo, spinning loading circle, etc), press and hold the power button again until your device is off.
3. Repeat steps **1** and **2**.
4. Press the power button again to turn on your device, allow Windows to start normally on the third boot, you should be taken to the Recovery Environment at this point.
