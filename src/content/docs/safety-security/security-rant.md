**[10:59 PM] PipeItToDevSda:** I know, it is why we are upset about Windows 7 running in the wild

**[10:59 PM] PipeItToDevSda:** You are causing the risk to our families, not the other way around

**[10:59 PM] Geeknificent:** It might mot be affecting you but it could be affecting someone else and you dont even know it

**[11:00 PM] NouH:** k

**[11:01 PM] NouH:** also whats this attack on hospitals thing about

**[11:01 PM] PipeItToDevSda:** Hospitals are a very large target for cyber attacks, those attacks get bred and spread through botnets

**[11:02 PM] PipeItToDevSda:** vulnerable hosts are hit by the hundreds to form botnets, old Windows 10 editions, Windows 7, XP, Vista, cctv camera, refrigerators. Anything hooked to the internet with lax security

**[11:02 PM] Bjoolz:** By using Windows 7 you are an extremely easy target for botnets. Don't even have to visit a shady website.

**[11:03 PM] PipeItToDevSda:** When a hospital gets hit, their efficiency is reduced. When you make people stop using computers and doing things by hand, they do things slower, there are more errors. when dealing with a hospital, time and mistakes kill people

**[11:03 PM] PipeItToDevSda:** In spain last year a woman was killed when she had to be diverted to a new hospital due to the closest being down to an attack. She died due to that extended route

**[11:04 PM] PipeItToDevSda:** The cyber world is not just your computer, it runs everything in your life. a computer virus will cause deadly 'real world' consequences reaching far beyond the measley files on your machine

**[11:07 PM] NouH:** the more you know...

**[11:07 PM] NouH:** i will keep that in mind, have a nice day folks

**[11:07 PM] PipeItToDevSda:** \o/
